The project is subdivided into multiple sections, stored in the following folders:

* PCB - The Kicad project for the PCB
* Firmware - The STM32CubeIDE project providing the firmware
* Scripts - Utilities for converting data
* BASIC2 - BBC BASIC programs for testing the multi-PHROM
* Images - Photos of the constructed PCB and installation

Each of these sections has their own README, providing more information.

# Firmware

These are STM32CubeIDE version 2 projects.

There are currently two projects defined, one for the STM32G031F8P6 and one for the STM32G051F8P6. Code common to both is in the Common folder.

The first 3 emulators produced were STM32G051F8P6 because that is what I had spare in my parts drawer. STM32C051F8P6 is also suitable but it seems these are in short supply.
